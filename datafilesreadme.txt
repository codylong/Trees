"Data/facetreesNoBad46pts.pickle"
   These are face trees that don't have "bad" (4,6) pts, as of our 
   January 12, 2017 understanding. The list of such "bad" points
   come from cones whose vertices (v1,v2,v3) have associated sum's
   of ai's (a,b,c) in the set

   bad = [[2,3,5],[1,3,4],[2,5,5],[3,4,4],[3,4,5]]

   This was derived by Ben in December and is being checked by Cody
   in January.
