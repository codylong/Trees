# Trees
Code for generating the Tree ensemble of Toric Threefolods. This ensemble was generated to determine a lower bound on the number of geometries suitable
for 4d F-theory compactifications (i.e., at finite distance from the bulk). To derive this lower bound, we considered toric blowups of an initial seed
3d base (6 real dimensions), and determined a subset of possible toric blowups in a local C^3 patch that preserve a special global section of O(-6 K_B) under the transition. This subset is defined by finding all posible combinations of toric rays obtained in a local patch by blowups, where no ray has "height" greater than 6, which in turn is a lattice combinatorial problem. The is available [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1603639).
