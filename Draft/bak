\begin{abstract}
We study universality of gauge sectors in the string landscape
in the context of F-theory compactifications.
A finite time construction algorithm for $\frac43 \times 1.4 \times 10^{755}$ F-theory geometries is presented. High probability geometric
assumptions uncover universal structures in the ensemble without
explicitly constructing it. For example, non-Higgsable clusters
of seven-branes with intricate gauge sectors occur with
probability above $1-1.07\times 10^{-755}$,  and
the geometric gauge group rank is above $160$ with probability
$.9999994$. In the latter case there are at least $10$ $E_8$
factors, the structure of which fixes the gauge groups
on certain nearby seven-branes. Visible sectors may arise from
flux-breaking, or from $E_6$ or $SU(3)$ seven-branes, which occur
in certain random samples with probability $\simeq 1/200$.

\noindent{\bf I. Introduction.} 
String theory is a theory of quantum gravity that naturally
gives rise to interesting gauge and cosmological sectors. As
such, it is a candidate unified theory. However, it gives
rise to a vast landscape of four-dimensional metastable vacua that
may realize different laws of physics, makings predictions difficult.
Other areas of physics signal a possible way forward, though,
since a large ensemble of states may exhibit universality.

Non-Higgsable clusters in $6d$ compactifications have been classified 
\cite{Morrison:2012np} and studied extensively \cite{Morrison:2012js,Taylor:2012dr,Morrison:2014era,Martini:2014iza,Johnson:2014xpa,Taylor:2015isa,}.

\noindent{\bf II. Seven-Branes and Non-Higgsable Clusters.}
A $4d$ F-theory geometry is a Calabi-Yau elliptic fibration
$X$ over a threefold base space $B$ defined by the equation
\begin{equation}
y^2=x^3+f x + g
\end{equation}
where $f$ and $g$ are homogeneous polynomials in the coordinates
of $B$; technically $f\in \Gamma(-4K_B)$, $g\in \Gamma(-6K_B)$,
with $K_B$ the canonical line bundle on $B$. $B$ provides extra spatial dimensions, and seven-branes are localized on the discriminant locus
$\Delta=0\subset B$, where $\Delta = 4f^3+27g^2$.

Upon compactification, the gauge group structure of seven-branes gives rise
to four-dimensional gauge sectors. It is controlled by $f$ and
$g$, and for a typical $B$ the most general $f, g$ take the
form $f=\tilde f \prod_i x_i^{l_i}$, $g=\tilde g \prod_i x_i^{m_i}$,
so
\begin{equation}
\Delta = \tilde \Delta\,\,  \prod_i x_i^{\text{min}(3l_i,2m_i)}=: \tilde \Delta\,\,  \prod_i x_i^{n_i},
\end{equation}
and therefore $f$, $g$ and $\Delta$ vanish along $x_i=0$ to 
$ord_{x_i}(f,g,\Delta)=(l_i,m_i,n_i).$ This seven-brane carries
a gauge group $G_i$ given in Table \ref{tab:gauge}
according to the Kodaira classification. In some cases
further geometric data is necessary to uniquely 
specify $G_i$, see e.g. 
\cite{Halverson:2015jua} for conditions, but this data
always exists for fixed $B$. 
For generic $f$ and $g$, a seven-brane on $x_i=0$
requires $(l_i,m_i)\geq(1,1)$.

Such a seven-brane is called a geometrically non-Higgsable
seven-brane (NH7) because it carries a gauge group that cannot
be removed by deforming $f$ or $g$. A NH7 may have geometric gauge group
\begin{equation}
G\in \{E_8,E_7,E_6,F_4,SO(8),G_2,SU(3),SU(2)\},
\end{equation} 
which could be broken by turning on particular fluxes. 
A typical base $B$, as
we will show in the strongest generality to date, has many non-Higgsable seven-branes
that often intersect in pairs, giving rise jointly charged
matter. Such a cluster of seven-brane is a
geometrically 
non-Higgsable cluster (NHC). For brevity, we henceforth drop the adjectives
geometric and geometrically.

\noindent{\bf III. Large Landscapes of Geometries from Trees.}

We now introduce our construction, which utilizes
building blocks in toric varieties that we call trees to systematically
build up F-theory geometries. After describing the geometric setup
and defining terms that simplify the discussion, we will present a criterion,
classify all trees satisfying it, and build F-theory geometries.


Our construction  begins with a simple starting point, a smooth weak-Fano toric threefold
$B_i$, and then builds structure on top of it. These geometries $B_i$ are 
determined by
fine regular star triangulations (FRST) of one of the $4319$ (c) $3d$
reflexive polytopes, and it has been estimated \cite{Halverson:2016tve} that there are $O(10^{15})$ such geometries. The $2d$ faces of the $3d$ polytope are known
as facets, and a triangulated polytope will have triangulated facets. 
None of these geometries have non-Higgsable seven-branes.

Consider such a $B_i$ determined by an FRST of a $3d$ reflexive polytope $\Delta^\circ$. Consider also a triangulated facet
$F$ 
in it and an edge between two points in $F$ with
edge vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, which have associated homogeneous
coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since  $v_1$ and $v_2$
are vertices of an edge they generate a $2d$ cone $\sigma_{12}$
in the
fan description of $B_i$, which means that $x_1=x_2=0$
defines an algebraic curve in $B_i$. This curve can be blown up by adding a new ray $v_e=v_1+v_2$ and appropriately subdividing the unique $3d$
cones that intersect at $\sigma_{12}$, giving a new smooth
toric variety $B$. A
coordinate $e$ is associated to $v_e$ and $e=0$ defines the
exceptional divisor in $B$. This process can be iterated,
for example blowing up along $e=x_1=0$ which would add a new
ray $v_e+v_1$. 

After a number of iterations the associated toric variety will have
a collection of exceptional divisors with associated rays
$v_{e_i}=a_i v_1 + b_i v_2$, which will appear to have formed
a \emph{tree} above the \emph{ground} that connects $v_1$ and
$v_2$ in $F$. Each $v_{e_i}$ is a $\emph{leaf}$ with
\emph{height} $h_{e_i}=a_i+b_i$, and 
we will refer to trees built on edges within $F$ as
$\emph{edge trees}$. The height of a tree is the height of
its highest leaf. As an example,
$\{v_1+v_2,2v_1+v_2,v_1+2v_2\}$ appears as
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick,color=ForestGreen] (.25,.5) -- (-.25,.5);
\fill (0,0) circle (.5mm);
\fill (.25,.5) circle (.5mm);
\fill (-.25,.5) circle (.5mm);
\fill (0,1) circle (.5mm);
\fill (-.25,1.5) circle (.5mm);
\fill (.25,1.5) circle (.5mm);
\draw (0,0) -- (.25,.5);
\draw (0,0) -- (-.25,.5);
\draw (0,0) -- (0,1);
\draw (0,0) -- (-.25,1.5);
\draw (0,0) -- (.25,1.5);
\node at (-.55,.5) {$v_1$};
\node at (.55,.5) {$v_2$};
\node at (0,-.25) {$0$};
\node at (0,1.25) {$2$};
\node at (-.45,1.6) {$3$};
\node at (.45,1.6) {$3$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where the green line is the edge (ground)
in $F$, $0$ is the origin of $\Delta^\circ$, and
the new rays are labelled by their heights.

Similarly, one can also build \emph{face trees} by beginning
with a face on $F$, with face vertices
$v_1, v_2, v_3$ having associated $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $3d$
cone $\sigma_{123}$. Adding $v_e=v_1+v_2+v_3$ and subdividing
$\sigma_{123}$ blows up at the point $x_1=x_2=x_3=0$  and produces a new toric variety. Again such
blowups can be iterated. This process builds a collection of
leaves
$v_{e_i}=a_i v_1 + b_i v_2 + c_i v_3$ with $a_i,b_i,c_i > 0$ of
height $h_{e_i}=a_i+b_i+c_i$ that comprise
a \emph{face tree}. Face trees are built above the interior of the face
due to the strict inequality in the definition. Note
if one leaf coefficient was zero the associated leaf would be above an edge
of the face, not above the face interior.

Geometries can be systematically constructed by adding a face tree to each face in each triangulated facet of $\Delta^\circ$, and then an edge tree to each edge. The associated smooth toric
threefold $B$ has a collection of rays $v$, each of which can be written $v=av_1+bv_2+cv_3$ with $v_i$ $3d$ cone vertices in $B_i$. If $(a,b,c)=(1,0,0)$ or some
permutation thereof, $v\in \Delta^\circ$ and this height $h_v=1$ ``leaf'' is more
appropriately a root, since it is on the ground.

A natural question
in systematically building up geometries is whether there is
a maximal tree height. For a toric variety $B$ to be an allowed
F-theory base it must not have any $(4,6)$ divisors, which
we ensure by a simple height criterion proven in Prop. \ref{prop:heightcrit}:
\begin{center}
If $h_v\leq 6$ for all leaves $v\in B$, \\ then there are no $(4,6)$
divisors.
\end{center}
This condition is simple and sufficient, but not necessary
for the absence of $(4,6)$ divisors. Nevertheless, it
will allow us to build a large class of geometries.


\vspace{.5cm}
The task is now clear: we must systematically build  all
topologically distinct edge trees and face trees of height 
$\leq 6$. Since the combinatorics are daunting, let us
exemplify the problem for $h\leq 3$ trees. Viewing the
facet head on, an edge appears as 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick,color=ForestGreen] (0,0) -- (1,0);
\fill (0,0) circle (.5mm);
\fill (1,0) circle (.5mm);
\node at (0,.3) {$v_1$};
\node at (1,.3) {$v_2$};
\node at (0,-.3) {$1$};
\node at (1,-.3) {$1$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where the vertices are labelled, as well as their height $1$.
With our definitions a ray on the ground (i.e. in a facet)
is technically a height $1$ leaf. Adding $v_1+v_2$ subdivides the
edge, which can then be further subdivided
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[thick,color=ForestGreen] (4,-.5) -- (5,-.5);
\fill (4,.0-.5) circle (.5mm);
\node at (4,-.3-.5) {$1$};
\fill (4.5,0-.5) circle (.5mm);
\node at (4.5,-.3-.5) {$2$};
\fill (4.25,0-.5) circle (.5mm);
\node at (4.25,-.3-.5) {$3$};
\fill (5,0-.5) circle (.5mm);

\draw[thick,->] (5.25,.38) -- (5.75,.1);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where we have dropped the vertex labels and kept the heights.
The trees emerge out of the page, but visualization is made easier
by projecting on to the edge. We see there are five
edge trees with height $\leq 3$. Similarly we have form face trees
via
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, every node/.style={scale=0.9}]
\draw[thick,color=ForestGreen] (90:.75) -- (90+120:.75) -- (90+120+120:.75) -- cycle;

\node at (0,-.2) {$3$};
\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
from which we see that there are $2$ face trees of height $\leq 3$. In this
image we have denoted the new edges by blue lines since they do
not sit in the facet. With our definitions edge trees are built above an edge
in the facet, whereas higher leaves in face trees may be built on new edges
that don't sit in the facet. For example, a height $4$ leaf could be added
on any of the blue lines above.

A tedious but straightforward calculation shows that the number of
edge or face trees with $h \leq N$ grows rapidly. See 
Table \ref{tab:numedgefacetreeandprob} for specifics of this growth,
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
$N$ & \# Edge Trees & \# Face Trees \\ \hline
$3$ & $5$ & $2$\\
$4$ & $10$ & $17$\\
$5$ & $50$ & $4231$ \\
$6$ & $82$ & $41,439,964$\\ \hline
\end{tabular} \hspace{1cm}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
$h_v$ & Probability \\ \hline
$3$ & $.99999998$ \\
$4$ & $.999995$ \\

$6$ & $.9999898$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\emph{Left:} The number of edge trees and face trees with of height $h\leq N$.
\emph{Right:} The probability that a face tree with $h\leq 6$ has a leaf $v$ with
a given height $h_v$.}
\label{tab:numedgefacetreeandprob}
\end{table}
and note that the number of trees with $h \leq 6$, as relevant in our
construction, is large. Rotations and flips should not be taken
into account now; symmetries will enter later.

\vspace{.5cm}
Having classified the number of $h\leq 6$ face trees and edge trees, we now estimate 
the number of toric varieties that may arise from putting trees on an FRST of 
$\Delta^\circ$. 
% To do so, we must differentiate between triangulated facets of $\Delta^\circ$ and
% faces on the facet, denoting them $\tilde F$ and $F$ respectively; similarly, $E$
% is an edge of $\Delta^\circ$ whereas $\tilde E$ is an edge of a triangulation of $F$
% or of $E$. 
We construct an ensemble $S_{\Delta^\circ}$ of geometries by systematically putting $h\leq 6$ face trees on all
faces $\tilde F$ of a triangulated facet $F$ and then putting $h\leq 6$ edge trees on
all edges $\tilde E$ in $F$. The number of ways of doing this overcounts
due to the fact that some
$\tilde E$ lie in two facets, i.e. on an edge $E$ of $\Delta^\circ$. Accounting
for this and using Table \ref{tab:numedgefacetreeandprob} we obtain an equation for the size of $S_{\Delta^\circ}$
\begin{equation}
|S_{\Delta^\circ}| = \sum_F 82^{\# \tilde E \, \text{on} \, F} (4.2\times 10^6)^{\# \tilde F \, \text{on} \, F} - \sum_E 82^{\# \tilde E \, \text{on} \, E},
\end{equation}
which may be simplified since on a triangulated facet $F$
\begin{equation}
\#\tilde E = 2n_B + 3n_I - 3 \qquad \# \tilde F = n_B+2n_I-2,
\end{equation}
where $n_I$ and $n_B$ are the number of facet interior and boundary points,
respectively. 

There are two polytopes that give a far larger number $|S_{\Delta^\circ}|$
than the others. They
are  the convex hulls $\Delta_i^\circ := \text{Conv}(S_i), i=1,2$ of the
vertex sets
\begin{align} 
S_1 &= \{ (-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,5),(-1,5,-1),(1,-1,-1)\} \nonumber \\
S_2 &= \{ (-1,-1,-1),(-1,-1,11),(-1,2,-1),(1,-1,-1)\}.
\end{align}
The largest facet of $\Delta_1^\circ$ is displayed in \ref{fig:bigfacetbigone1}, 
which has $\# \tilde E = 63$ and $\# \tilde F=36$. Taking into
account symmetry arguments that we will make later, a 
direct computation
yields
\begin{equation}
|\sdoc| = \frac{1.4}{3} \times 10^{755} \qquad |\sdtc| = 1.4 \times 10^{755},
\label{eqn:sdocsdtccounts}
\end{equation}

configurations. This gives a lower bound
\begin{equation}
\text{\# 4d F-theory Geometries} \geq \frac43 \times 1.4 \times 10^{755},
\end{equation}
which undercounts due to the fact that we choose to do face blowups followed by
edge blowups to simplify the subdivision combinatorics.

\noindent{\bf IV. Universality and Non-Higgsable Clusters.}

We now study universality in the dominant sets of
F-theory geometries $\sdoc$ and $\sdtc$. We prove non-Higgsable cluster universality, minimal gauge group universality,
and discuss initial results from random sampling.

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent \textbf{Non-Higgsable Cluster Universality.} We wish to establish
the likelihood that an F-theory base in $\sdoc$ or $\sdtc$ give rise to
non-Higgsable seven-branes. The result arises from Prop. \ref{prop:NH7fromsingletree}.



Summarizing it, if there is a tree anywhere on $F$, even a single leaf, there is a
non-Higgsable seven-brane on the divisor associated to each point $p$ interior to $F$.
For any $S_{\Delta^\circ}$ only one configuration has no trees, and therefore
\begin{equation}
P(\text{NHC in } S_{\Delta^\circ}) = 1 - \frac{1}{|S_{\Delta^\circ}|}.
\end{equation}
This is always very close to one, and in particular
\begin{align}
P(\text{NHC in } \sdoc) &= 1-2.14\times 10^{-755} \nonumber \\
P(\text{NHC in } \sdtc) &= 1-.71\times 10^{-755},
\end{align}
for the dominant ensembles in our construction. Non-Higgsable clusters are universal in these ensembles.

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent \textbf{Gauge Group Universality.} We now wish to study physics in
our ensemble. Consider a geometric assumption $A_i$
and a physical property $P_i$ such that $A_i\to P_i$. Our goal is to determine high
probability assumptions that lead to interesting physical properties, computing $P(A_i)$
since $A_i\to P_i$ ensures $P(P_i)\geq P(A_i).$ We will focus $\sdoc$ and $\sdtc$ since
these dominate the ensemble.

Consider first $\sdoc$ and let $A_1$ be the assumption that any simplex in an FRST 
of $\doc$ containing a vertex of $\doc$ has an $h\geq 3$ face tree on it. 
For the $3$ symmetric facets of $\doc$ there are $17$ ways to choose simplices
containing the vertices, and $1796$ ways for its largest facet. The maximum
number of simplices containing vertices is $24$, and $P(h\geq 3 \,\, \text{tree on simplex}) = .9999998$ from Table \ref{tab:numedgefacetreeandprob}
\begin{equation}
P(A_1\textin\sdoc)\geq .9999998^{24}=.9999994.
\end{equation}
There are $17^3\times1796$ ways to choose simplices that contain the vertices,
all of which have $G\geq F_4^{18}\times E_6^{10}\times U^9$ where 
$U\in\{G_2,F_4,E_6\}$ depending on details and all of these factors arise on
the ground; generally there will be many more factors from non-Higgsable seven-branes
in the leaves. Here $E_6^{10}$ arises from an $E_6$ on every interior point
of the large facet in $\doc$, see Fig. \ref{fig:bigfacetbigone1}. This set of
statements defines physical property $P_1$, and since $A_1\to P_1$
we deduce $P(P_1\textin \sdoc)\geq P(A_1\textin \sdoc) \geq .9999994$.

Let $A_2$ be the assumption that there exists a $h=5$ face tree somewhere
on the large facet $F$ in $\doc$. Knowing $\tilde F=36$ on $F$ and using
Table \ref{tab:numedgefacetreeandprob}, we compute $P(A_2 \textin \sdoc)=(1-(1-.999997)^{36})\simeq 1-10^{-199}.$ Let $A_3$ be that $A_1$ and $A_2$ hold, so 
$P(A_3)=P(A_1)P(A_2)\simeq P(A_1)$. Then given $A_3$ a short calculation shows 
that the  $h=5$ tree on $F$ 
enhances $E_6$ in $P_1$ to $E_8$, giving $10$ $E_8$'s on the ground. $P_1$ with this enhancement defines $P_3$. 

The  geometric gauge group on a leaf $v$ in a tree built above $E_8$'s
is determined by the leaf height $h_v$, as proven in Prop. \ref{prop:E8roots} in the Appendix. 
The result is that a $h_v=1,2,3,4,5,6$ leaf
above $E_8$ roots has Kodaira fiber $F_v=II^*,IV^*_{ns},I^*_{0,ns},IV_{ns},II,-$
with gauge group $G_v=E_8,F_4,G_2,SU(2),-,-$, respectively.

This leads to a high probability result about the structure of the geometric gauge group.
Since $A_3\to P_3$, which has at least $10$ $E_8$ factors nearby one another, $P_3$
also has
\begin{equation}
G\geq F_4^{18}\times U^9\times E_8^{10}\times F_4^{H_2}\times G_2^{H_3}\times A_1^{H_4},
\end{equation}
where $H_i$ is the number of height $i$ leaves in trees built on $E_8$ roots,
and $rk(G)\geq 160+4H_2+2H_3+H_4$.
There are $H_6$ Kodaira type $II$ seven-branes. The first $F_4$ and also
the $U$ factors may enhance, but the  are fixed. The probability
of this physical property is $P(P_3\textin \sdoc)\geq P(A_3\textin \sdoc) \simeq .9999994$. This non-trivial minimal gauge structure is universal in our large ensemble $\sdoc$.

\XXX{cl,bs}{jh}{These are for assumptions in $\sdoc$. Could one of your do the
same calculations for $\sdtc$? Also, note new comment method, courtesy of
network science guys.}


\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent \textbf{Random Samples and Geometric Visible Sectors.} 
It may be possible to accomodate visible sectors from flux breaking
these gauge sectors, but it is also interesting to study whether gauge
factors $E_6$ and / or $SU(3)$ arise with high probability.
We have not yet discovered a high probability simple geometric assumption
that leads to $E_6$ or $SU(3)$. However, it is possiblethat they arise regularly,
but due to a complex geometric assumption.

This idea can be tested by random sampling. Let $B$ be an F-theory base obtained
by adding face trees at random, followed by edge trees at random, to the pushing 
triangulation of $\doc$. We studied an ensemble $S_r$ of $10^6$ such random samples 
and found $P(SU(3) \, \text{or} \, E_6 \textin S_r)\simeq 1/200$, and that at least 
$36$ of the points in $\doc$ carried $E_8$, a significant enhancement beyond
assumption $3$.  Furthermore, in our sample we found that $E_6$ only
arose on the point $(1,-1,-1)$, which is the only vertex of $\doc$
that isn't in the largest facet. It would be interesting to study random samples of other triangulations, or
see if new simple geometric assumptions imply these enhancements. We leave this,
and the systematic study of geometric visible sectors, to future work.

\noindent \textbf{V. Discussion.} 

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent \textbf{A. Appendix: Technical Subtleties.} We now
address technical subtleties that are important for establishing,
but not understanding, results in the main text.

In equation \eqref{eqn:sdocsdtccounts} 
we have included a factor of
$1/3$ relative to the count one would obtain directly from the algorithm.
This takes into account an overcounting of geometries due to toric equivalences,
which arise when there is a $GL(3,\bZ)$ transformation on the toric rays
that preserves the cone structure of the fan. In general, there may
be many such equivalences between elements of two ensembles $S_{\Delta_i^\circ}$
and $S_{\Delta_j^\circ}$, where $\Delta_{i,j}^\circ$ are any two $3d$ reflexive
polytopes. However, to ensure that the count  \eqref{eqn:sdocsdtccounts} is accurate,
we only need to consider whether there are equivalences between
two elements in $\sdoc$, two in $\sdtc$, or one in $\sdoc$ to $\sdtc$. It is sufficient to consider $GL(3,\bZ)$ actions
on the ground, i.e. on the facets. This follows from the fact that rays of different height cannot be exchanged under automorphisms of the fan. First note that points in a hyperplane remain in a
hyperplane after a $GL(3,\bZ)$ transformation, and points
in a line remain in a line. Facet must therefore map to
facets. The big facets in $\doc$ and $\dtc$ cannot map
to other facets by point counting, and therefore they
must map to themselves. There is no non-trivial map
taking the big facet in $\dtc$ to itself, but there is
a $\bZ_3$ rotation taking the big facet in $\doc$ to itself, giving a factor of $1/3$ in $\sdoc$. There is no non-trivial
map between the big facets in $\doc$ and $\dtc$, and therefore
$\sdtc\cap \sdoc  = \emptyset.$ Together, these establish
\eqref{eqn:sdocsdtccounts}.

\XXX{all}{jh}{Check Hayakawa-Wang below. Need to figure out how / where to include
Ben's functorial stuff, but this is minimal start that I believe is correct after
looking through my correspondence with Dave.}

In discussing what constitutes a good $4d$ F-theory geometry $X\to B$, we mentioned
certain criteria on orders of vanishing that we now elaborate on. In 
\cite{Hayakawa,Wang} it was shown that if a Calabi-Yau variety has at worst
canonical singularities, it is at finite distance 
from the bulk of the moduli space in the Weil-Petersson metric. 
This criterion is general and therefore applies to elliptic fibrations such as $X$.
The reason that it is physically relevant is that if $X$ has worse singularities
than a nearby Calabi-Yau $X'$ that is known to represent a physical configuration,
and $X$ is at finite distance in the moduli space from $X'$, we should expect that
$X$ is also a physical configuration. This criterion, which we refer to as the
Hayakawa-Wang criterion, gives a related criterion by studying elliptic
fibrations:
if $ord_C(f,g)\leq(4,6)$ and $ord_p(f,g)\leq(8,12)$ 
for all curves $C\subset B$ and points $p\subset B$
then  $X$ has at worst
canonical singularities and is at finite distance in the
moduli space due to the Hayakawa-Wang criterion\footnote{We thank D. Morrison for discussions on
this and related points.}. This latter criterion, which we refer to as the weak OOV (orders
of vanishing) criterion, is sufficient but not necessary for at worst canonical singularities; for example a rich set of $6d$ $N=1$
SCFTs \cite{Heckman:2013pva} arises from relaxing the $(4,6)$ condition on 
codimension two loci in the base. Furthermore, if $B$ is such that $X\to B$
does not satisfy the weak OOV criterion, but there is a blowup $B'\to B$ such
that $X'\to B'$ does, then $X$ also has at worst canonical singularities
and is at finite distance in moduli space.

For geometries in our construction to satisfy the Hayakawa-Wang criterion it
suffices to show that if $X\to B$ does not satisfy weak OOV, then there is a
blowup $B'\to B$ such that $X'\to B'$ does. This is straightforward.
Consider any toric curve $C=D_s\cdot D_t \subset B$. Take $v_s=\sum_i a_{i,s} v_i$ and $v_t=\sum_i a_{i,t} v_i$ and define $a:=\sum_i a_{i,s}$ and $b:=\sum_i a_{i,t}$. Let $F$ be a facet
on which or above which $v_s$ and $v_t$ sit, with $m_F$ the facet dual. As an
element of $\Delta_g$ the associated monomial may be written
$s^{\vev{m,v_s}+6}t^{\vev{m,v_t}+6}\times \dots$,
and the monomial vanishes to order $\vev{m,v_s}+\vev{m,v_t}+12=-a-b+12$ along $C$,
which must be $\geq 6$ for $C$ to be a $(4,6)$ curve. Therefore $a+b\leq 6$ is necessary for
$C$ to be a $(4,6)$ curve.
Now suppose $C$ is a $(4,6)$ curve that we blow up via $B'\to B$ by
adding an exceptional divisor $v_e = \sum a_i v_i = v_s + v_t$. Then $\sum a_i=a+b$,
which satisfies $\sum a_i\leq 6$ since $C$ is $(4,6)$, but this condition is sufficient to ensure that $\hat B$ has no $(4,6)$ divisors! If $2a+b\leq 6$
or $a+2b\leq 6$ then $B'$ may still have a $(4,6)$ curve, but
this blowup process can be iterated until there are no longer
$(4,6)$ curves or divisors.  A similar argument
holds for each $(4,6)$ point $p=D_s\cdot D_t \cdot D_u \subset  B$, with $v_s$
and $v_t$ as before and $v_u=\sum_i a_{i,u} v_i$ with 
$c:=\sum_i a_{i,u}$. 
%There is a unique facet $F$ above which
%or on which $v_{s,t,u}$ all sit, and $m_F$ is the dual to $F$. 
Considering
it as an element of $\Delta_g$ leads to the condition that $a+b+c\leq 6$
is necessary for $p$ to be a $(4,6)$ point, and as before we can perform blowups
until there no longer are $(4,6)$ points. Performing iterative blowups of points
and curves in this way gaurantee the existence of a map $B'\to B$ such that the
weak OOV criterion is satisfied.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:heightcrit}
Suppose each leaf $v\in B$ has height $h_v\leq 6$. Then $B$ has
no $(4,6)$ divisors.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider a facet
$F$, which has a unique associated point $m_F$ satisfying
$(m_F,\tilde v)=-1 \,\, \forall \tilde v \in F$; furthermore
since $m_F\in\Delta$, 
$(m_F,v)\geq -1\,\, \forall v\in\Delta^\circ$. Now
suppose $h_v \leq 6/n, \,\, n \in \mathbb{N}$  
for all rays $v=av_1 + b v_2 + c v_3$
in $B$, with $v_i$ $3d$ cone vertices in $B_i$ . Then 
$(nm_F, v)\geq -n(a+b+c)=-nh_v\geq -6$ for all rays $v$ and
therefore $nm_F \in \Delta_g.$ If $h_v\leq 6\,\, \forall v$,
then $m_F\in\Delta_g$. This monomial has order of vanishing
$(v,m_F)+6=5$ for any $v$ in or above $F$, which protects
$v$ from being a $(4,6)$ divisor. If
$h_v\leq 6 \,\, \forall v$ then $m_F \in \Delta_g\,\, \forall F$
and there is a monomial that prevents
each divisor from being $(4,6)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:NH7fromsingletree}
Suppose $\exists \, v $ in or above a facet $F$,i.e. $v=av_1+bv_2+cv_3$ with $v_i$ simplex vertices in $F$, such that $h_v\geq 2$. Then there is a non-Higgsable seven-brane on the divisor associated
to each interior point of $F$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Then $(6 m_F,v)=-6h_v \leq -12$ implies $6m_F \notin \Delta_g$.
Similarly, $4m_F \notin \Delta_f$. Since any point $p$ interior to $F$ has 
$(m,p)=-1 \leftrightarrow m=m_F$ and reflexive polytopes of dimension three
are normal, i.e. any $m_f\in \Delta_f$ ($m_f \in \Delta_g$) has
$m_f = \sum_i m_i, m_i\in \Delta$ ($m_g = \sum_i m_i, m_i\in \Delta$),
it follows that $(m_f,p)=-4 \leftrightarrow m_f = 4m_F$ and $(m_g,p)=-6 \leftrightarrow m_g = 6m_F$. Therefore is there is any tree on $F$
then $4m_F \notin \Delta_f$ and $6m_F\notin \Delta_g$. By normality,
for any $p$ interior to $F$ this implies
$\nexists m_f \in \Delta_f | (m_f,p)=-4$ and
$\nexists m_g \in \Delta_g | (m_g,p)=-6$, and therefore $ord_p(f,g) > (0,0)$,
which implies there is a non-Higgsable seven-brane on the divisor associated to $p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:E8roots}
Let $v$ be a leaf $v=av_1 + bv_2 + cv_3$ with $v_i$ simplex vertices in $F$. If
the associated the divisors $D_{1,2,3}$
carry a non-Higgsable $E_8$ seven-brane, then if $v$ has height
 $h_v=1,2,3,4,5,6$ it also has Kodaira fiber $F_v=II^*,IV^*_{ns},I^*_{0,ns},IV_{ns},II,-$
and gauge group $G_v=E_8,F_4,G_2,SU(2),-,-$, respectively.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Recall that the height criterion
gives $ord_v(g)\leq 6-h_v$. If $v=av_1+bv_2+cv_3$ with $v_i$ each carrying $E_8$,
then 
$(m_f,v_i)\geq 0, (m_g,v_i)\geq -1\,\,, \forall m_f\in \Delta_f 
$ and $\forall m_g\in \Delta_g$.
This gives $(m_f,v)\geq 0$, $(m_g,v)\geq-(a+b+c)= -h_v$. Together, we see
$ord_v(f)\geq 4$, $ord_v(g)=6-h_v$. For $h_v= 1,5,6$ this fixes $G_v$, but 
to determine $G_v$ for $h_v=2,3,4$ we must study the split condition. A necessary
condition is that there is one monomial $m_g\in \Delta_g$ such that $(m_g,v)+6=6-h_v$,
and since $m_F \in \Delta_g$ always, where $F$ is the facet in which $v_i$ lie,
then $m_g=m_F$. Morever, the monomial $m$ in $g$ associated to $m_F$ must be a perfect
square; since $(m_F,v_i)+6=5$, $m\sim x_i^5$ and $m$ is not a perfect square. 
Therefore the fibers are all non-split. This establishes the result.
\end{proof}
